      <h2>Home Page – Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What is the course about?</strong> The Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course focuses on learning various data structures and algorithms, understanding their complexities, and applying them to solve computational problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</strong> We have studied arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and algorithms such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and graph algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How do you connect the course with real-time applications?</strong> These algorithms are used in real-time applications such as GPS navigation systems, database indexing, network optimization, and resource scheduling.

      <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
      <h3>1. Types of Problems in Nature</h3>
      <p>
        Problems in nature include iteration, recursion, and backtracking. Examples are finding shortest paths (iteration), solving puzzles (recursion), and generating permutations (backtracking).
      </p>

      <h3>2. Importance of Space and Time Efficiency</h3>
      <p>
        Efficiency is critical for scalability. Classifications like constant, linear, logarithmic, and polynomial growth help us understand performance across different scales.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Design Principles</h3>
      <p>
        Key principles include divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, and backtracking. Understanding when to apply each is essential for designing effective solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Trees and Graphs</h3>
      <p>
        Tree data structures (e.g., binary search trees, AVL trees) optimize hierarchical data storage. Graphs are used for relationships, such as social networks and routing problems.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h3>
      <p>
        Sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort are essential for ordering data efficiently. Searching algorithms, including binary search, improve data retrieval times.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Graph Algorithms</h3>
      <p>
        Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Prim’s solve shortest path and spanning tree problems. They are crucial in network optimization and resource allocation.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Algorithm Design Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Techniques like dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer provide systematic ways to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.

      <h2>Reflective Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>1. How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</strong></p>
      <p>By analyzing the constraints and requirements, understanding available algorithmic techniques, and selecting the one with the best time and space complexity while considering scalability.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Reflect on a situation where you need to balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design. What approach did you take?</strong></p>
      <p>I prioritized the constraints based on criticality and implemented a compromise solution that addressed the most significant constraints without drastically affecting the others.</p>

      <p><strong>3. What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</strong></p>
      <p>The criteria include runtime efficiency, memory usage, adaptability to edge cases, and real-world feasibility.</p>

      <p><strong>4. How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</strong></p>
      <p>By generalizing the solution and incorporating modular updates that address the new requirements while retaining the core functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>5. What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in complex datasets or problems?</strong></p>
      <p>Visualizing the data, using statistical analysis, and leveraging domain knowledge to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.</p>

      <p><strong>6. How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</strong></p>
      <p>For smaller-scale problems or when rapid development is required, simplicity is prioritized. Optimization is chosen for performance-critical or large-scale problems.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Reflect on how breaking down a problem into smaller components can help you approach it more effectively.</strong></p>
      <p>Decomposing a problem into manageable parts makes it easier to tackle complexity and allows testing and debugging smaller segments independently.</p>

      <p><strong>8. Reflect on the trade-offs while choosing between different approaches to solve a problem.</strong></p>
      <p>Trade-offs involve time complexity, space usage, implementation effort, and scalability. Choosing depends on which factor is more critical for the problem at hand.</p>

      <p><strong>9. How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</strong></p>
      <p>By testing against edge cases, analyzing performance under extreme conditions, and seeking feedback for iterative improvement.</p>

      <p><strong>10. Reflect on how applying knowledge from one context can help you solve a problem in a different context.</strong></p>
      <p>Knowledge transfer allows leveraging proven strategies in new domains, leading to innovative solutions and cross-disciplinary advancements.</p>

      <p><strong>11. How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</strong></p>
      <p>When the existing solutions do not meet the problem constraints or new requirements emerge, innovation is preferred; otherwise, reliable methods are chosen for consistency and efficiency.</p>
